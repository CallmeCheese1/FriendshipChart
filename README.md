# Friendship Chart # 

This is the repository and page for my mini project for COMP-SCI 191, where we were required to create a program based on graph theory that llows us to map out a friend group. I created this using vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and using the Javascript library Cytoscape for the graph visualization.
